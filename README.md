# Project 1: Web Application
JayC / Jay Camp

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to use a console application to talk to an API that requests data to and from a SQL Database. My application used an Energy Report structure from Demand Response ISOs located inside the USA as companies would want to use as a way to save money in energy responses. Users can read, insert, update, and delete data such as the hour, region, mega watts from within the console application for NEISO.
