# Project 1: Web Application
220307 UTA .NET / Richard Hawkins

This project is a refinement of my previous project, P0. It was mostly redone from the ground up, and split into two parts, the console, and the API. The number of features was reduced, so instead of 4 pages of interaction, there was only one. However the overall speed of the functions was increased dramatically and it was set up to run on a backend API. 

The console was written in C# and created with WPF, using Visual Studio 2022. The APi was also writen in C# using Visual Studio 2022 and then uploaded to the Azure cloud. Both parts of the program connected to an SQL database written using Azure Data Studio. During development it was decided that both should have access to it, though the console could read only, as this would increase efficiency.
