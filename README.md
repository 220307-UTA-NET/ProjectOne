# ProjectOne

This is my first project as a Revature Associate.
It is an app that uses RESTful API to store/share information about museum patrons. The information is stored on an Azure Sql server. 
The front end is a console application.

There are also devops aspects. It can be run as a Docker image and has a CI/CD pipleline through github actions.
